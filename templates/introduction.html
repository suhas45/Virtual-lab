    <p><b>Virtual Labs for Teachers:</b></p>
    <p>Virtual Labs has the potential to bring paradigm shift in the way courses are taught today. For example, the teachers can take it to the class and demonstrate live examples while they are teaching difficult concepts to the students. Many difficult concepts are already integrated in the provided course curriculum. It can also complement the existing labs, wherein the students can be given assignments before or after the lab. The teacher can actively coordinate that effort to enable inclusive learning for all the students.</p>
    <p><b>Virtual Labs for Students:</b></p>
    <p>Students will get a feel of the real lab, as all lab equipment, components and lab behavior would be mimicked in the system. Extensive 2D animations are used to provide real-like look and feel to the students. The instruments and components are modeled accurately to provide real-like response. Interactive animations are also provided at a lot of places to enable student learning.</p>
    <p><b>Key features of Virtual Labs:</b></p>
    <p>Available 24X7. So students can learn difficult concepts at their own pace. Real looking components, to give the user a feel of the real laboratory. Step by step wizard to guide the students through the experiments.</p>
